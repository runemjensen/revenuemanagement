\section[Theorem and ...]{Theorem and theorem like environments}

{cas-sc.cls} provides a few shortcuts to format theorems and
theorem-like environments with ease. In all commands the options that
are used with the \verb+\newtheorem+ command will work exactly in the same
manner. {cas-sc.cls} provides three commands to format theorem or
theorem-like environments: 

\begin{verbatim}
 \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
 \newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}
 \newdefinition{rmk}{Remark}
 \newproof{pf}{Proof}
 \newproof{pot}{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm2}}
\end{verbatim}


\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For system (8), consensus can be achieved with 
$\|T_{\omega z}$ ...
\begin{eqnarray}\label{10}
....
\end{eqnarray}
\end{theorem}

\section{Bibliography}

Two bibliographic style files (\verb+*.bst+) are provided ---
{model1-num-names.bst} and {model2-names.bst} --- the first one can be
used for the numbered scheme. This can also be used for the numbered
with new options of {natbib.sty}. The second one is for the author year
scheme. When  you use model2-names.bst, the citation commands will be
like \verb+\citep+,  \verb+\citet+, \verb+\citealt+ etc. However when
you use model1-num-names.bst, you may use only \verb+\cite+ command.

\verb+thebibliography+ environment.  Each reference is a
\verb+\bibitem+ and each \verb+\bibitem+ is identified by a label,
by which it can be cited in the text:

\noindent In connection with cross-referencing and
possible future hyperlinking it is not a good idea to collect
more that one literature item in one \verb+\bibitem+.  The
so-called Harvard or author-year style of referencing is enabled
by the \LaTeX{} package {natbib}. With this package the
literature can be cited as follows:


\begin{enumerate}[\textbullet]
\item Parenthetical: \verb+\citep{WB96}+ produces (Wettig \& Brown, 1996).
\item Textual: \verb+\citet{ESG96}+ produces Elson et al. (1996).
\item An affix and part of a reference:
\verb+\citep[e.g.][Ch. 2]{Gea97}+ produces (e.g. Governato et
al., 1997, Ch. 2).
\end{enumerate}

In the numbered scheme of citation, \verb+\cite{<label>}+ is used,
since \verb+\citep+ or \verb+\citet+ has no relevance in the numbered
scheme.  {natbib} package is loaded by {cas-sc} with
\verb+numbers+ as default option.  You can change this to author-year
or harvard scheme by adding option \verb+authoryear+ in the class
loading command.  If you want to use more options of the {natbib}
package, you can do so with the \verb+\biboptions+ command.  For
details of various options of the {natbib} package, please take a
look at the {natbib} documentation, which is part of any standard
\LaTeX{} installation.

\appendix
\section{My Appendix}
Appendix sections are coded under \verb+\appendix+.

\verb+\printcredits+ command is used after appendix sections to list 
author credit taxonomy contribution roles tagged using \verb+\credit+ 
in frontmatter.
