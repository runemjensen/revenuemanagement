\section{Introduction}

Revenue Management (RM) is about providing customers with the right product at the right price at the right time. As an example, consider an airline operating an air plane with 100 seats offering 50\% student discount. If the airline experiences that it can sell 80 tickets at full price, it should allocate 80 seats to these passengers and only offer them to students close to departure if the alternative is an empty seat.

Advanced RM methods have been developed in the airline industry due to an early deregulation in 1978 \cite{Act78}.
